# industrial-temp-dashboard
Historian-style industrial temperature operations dashboard built with Python, PostgreSQL, and Streamlit. Includes an asset hierarchy template (site→area→unit→equipment→tag), KPI tiles (current, 1h avg, 24h max, missing-data rate), trend charts, and rule-based overheat event detection (threshold + duration).
